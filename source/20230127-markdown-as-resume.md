## Build online resume by markdown

It is quite annoying to maintain resume in multiple format, MS Word, PDF, TXT as well as wanna to have an HTML format online. 

found Github markdown editor is very handy to draft a nice resume. Here is a sample template: [resume.md](https://github.com/casualwriter/casual-markdown-cv/blob/main/resume.md), however, it is not good enough to send to recruiter.

so, add a little code, and transform to online resume with nice [layout](https://raw.githack.com/casualwriter/casual-markdown-cv/main/resume.html) (self-host at github).

then may print it to PDF format, and share by url. (for github, it can accessed by raw.githack.com natually)

### Themes

TBD
