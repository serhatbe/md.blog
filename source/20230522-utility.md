## Negative Utility

You need a book, a pen, and time. More tools give you negative utility. They won’t make the work go faster. But they will consume as much time as you are willing to waste.

### Productivity advice

Do the work.

That’s all the productivity advice you need, and the only useful productivity advice you’re ever going to get.

You can direct your attention to a million optimizations— email, meetings, notes, calendar, time tracking, goals, to-do lists, time estimates, prioritization frameworks, quantified self sensors, analytics, apps, documents, journaling.

But don’t. Ignore all this, and **do the work**. When you do the work, everything else optimizes itself.
