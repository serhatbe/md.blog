## Markdown as Blog

Quite happy to use markdown to draft document or blog post, but publish to web is 
a little trouble which need to 

1. find a web hosting
2. setup blog framework (e.g. wordpress)
3. design layout, menu navigation, etc..
4. start draft post
5. publish the post

Can we just simply write to markdown file and post it?

Yes.

1. find a free web hosting. e.g. github-page
2. setup some basic info (e.g. blog site title, about me) in index.md
3. start draft posts in markdown.
