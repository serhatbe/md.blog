## A Theory
Proposed by philosophers and recently supported by experimental psychologists, there's considerable evidence showing that if we hear something, we assume it to be true. This tendency is sometimes referred to as **truth-default theory**.

### Truth Bias

Truth bias is people's inclination towards believing, to some degree, the communication of another person, regardless of whether or not that person is actually lying or being untruthful It is human nature to believe communication is honest, which in turn makes humans highly vulnerable to deception. Consequently, a person's ability to detect deception is weakened, particularly when the source of deception is unfamiliar. As long as a person already has the perception that everything they are told is true, they are still considered to be truth-biased.
