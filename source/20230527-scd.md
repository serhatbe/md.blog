## The Five Rules Of The Slow-Carb Diet

Rule 1
Avoid “white” starchy carbo- hydrates (or those that can be white). This means no bread, pasta, rice, potatoes, or grains.
Rule 2
Eat the same few meals over and over again, especially for breakfast and lunch. You already do this; you’re just picking new default meals.
Rule 3
Don’t drink calories. Exception: 1–2 glasses of dry red wine per night is allowed.
Rule 4
Build each of your meals from the list below, picking one item from each of the three groups. Don’t eat fruit. Generally speaking: Fructose glycerol phosphate more body fat. Five hundred years ago, your ancestors probably didn’t eat oranges in December. Get vitamin C from your veggies.
Rule 5
Take one day off per week and go nuts. I recommend Saturday, often nicknamed “Faturday” by followers.
