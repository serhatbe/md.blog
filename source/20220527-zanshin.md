## Zanshin

Zanshin is a word used commonly throughout Japanese martial arts to refer to a state of relaxed alertness. Literally translated, zanshin means “the mind with no remainder.” In other words, the mind completely focused on action and fixated on the task at hand. **Zanshin is being constantly aware of your body, mind, and surroundings without stressing yourself. It is an effortless vigilance.**

In practice, though, zanshin has an even deeper meaning. Zanshin is choosing to live your life intentionally and acting with purpose rather than mindlessly falling victim to whatever comes your way.

We can carry this philosophy into many areas of life.

* **Writing:** The battle does not end when you publish a book. It ends when you consider yourself a finished product, when you lose the vigilance needed to continue improving your craft.
* **Fitness:** The battle does not end when you hit a PR. It ends when you lose concentration and skip workouts or when you lose perspective and overtrain.

The enemy of improvement is neither failure nor success. **The enemy of improvement is boredom, fatigue, and lack of concentration**. The enemy of improvement is a lack of commitment to the process because the process is everything.
