## Compromises
Tried several options:

* Static site generators, Jekyll-based options and Python scripts

* Simple html files using Notepad++ to build a website to hold my notes


Now I'm back to .md files using Zettlr, because it supports:
* Math typesetting i.e. good $\LaTeX$ support

* Easy input of more commands in .md than in .html using Notepad++

* Easy .html and .pdf generation

* Citation built-in with Zotero
