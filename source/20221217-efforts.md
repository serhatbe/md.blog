## Effort vs Results

Do not confuse effort with results.

Just because you put in the effort does not mean you'll get the desired result.

A lot of effort gets undone long before results are felt. Going to the gym is undone if you eat poorly. Focusing only on work gets undone by the inevitable health and relationship issues that come from under-investment. When we try to speed up the outcome, our lack of patience undoes the result.

Results are accumulated in drops but lost in buckets.Make sure you're not undoing the things you're trying to accomplish.
