## What is PechaKucha?

Dytham and Klein developed a new form of presenting they have dubbed “pecha kucha” (Japanese for “chatter”). This form of presentation style has a simple set of rules—exactly 20 slides displayed for 20 seconds each. Say what you need to say in six minutes and forty seconds.

## What is a Haiku?

The haiku is a Japanese poetic form that consists of three lines, with five syllables in the first line, seven in the second, and five in the third. The haiku developed from the hokku, the opening three lines of a longer poem known as a tanka. The haiku became a separate form of poetry in the 17th century.

The haiku began gaining mainstream recognition outside Japan in the early 20th century. In the English-speaking world, the form was popularized by Imagists such as Ezra Pound and later by Beat poets such as Allen Ginsberg.
