## The Basic Laws of Human Stupidity

The basic laws assert that

1. There will always be more stupid people than you think
2. The proportion of stupid people is invariant to intellectual, social or geographic segmentation
3. A stupid person is a person who causes losses to another person or to a group of persons while himself deriving no gain and possibly incurring losses
4. Non-stupid people always underestimate the damaging power of stupid individuals
