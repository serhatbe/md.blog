## Wise Man Said

Beyond this, feel free to add: deep understanding of what’s been done on your instrument over the past hundred years, achieved through close listening and transcription, not to mention a working familiarity with dozens of splintering schools of thought and definitions of improvisation itself across a similar time period, to be achieved by, again, close listening to a hundred-year body of work currently accessible in nearly its entirety to anyone with an internet connection and a device capable of audio playback.
