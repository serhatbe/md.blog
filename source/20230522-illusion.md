## Focusing Illusion

The idea that you can be focused on a particular aspect of life, so much so that you can believe that your whole happiness depends on it. In having a focusing illusion, you create your own reason for feeling unhappy. Mogi (2018)

If unhappiness is a vacuum in which the required element is absent, the vacuum is created by the biased imagination of the subject. There is no absolute formula for happiness - each unique condition of life can serve as the foundation for happiness in its own unique way. Mogi (2018)
